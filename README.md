# cop-3701-Smart-Grid-Energy-Consumption-Database

## Project Scope:
The database will have electrical measurements and values a span of ~4 years (2006-2010 from the dataset) and centered for analytic understanding (finding trends and relationships). 
The main data being peak-load detection, rolling demand analysis (through averages and rolling sums), and time-based aggregation (daily, weekly, and monthly); 
for scalability the energy consumption will be partitioned through intervals of either years or months and indexed.

## Users:
I would say the intended users would be people like Energy Analysts (try to find trends and patterns), 
Utility Providers (managing resources based patterns), Reasearchers or Students (understanding and or learning), and possibly System Admins.
